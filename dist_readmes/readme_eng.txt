* 1  - Introduction -

"Langobardia Horribilis: in Trebia" is an action horror videogame set in a fictional version of Italy during the Dark ages, where a catastrosphic event has caused an invasion of otherwordly monsters and horrors.

The player impersonates Walfrit, a Lombard warrior who has been sent with other soldiers to river Trebia, with a mission to retrieve the Holy lance from the abandoned church of Sancti Columbani. However, a flood has surprised him and his comrades, and now he is the only survivor.

Lost in the cursed lands of Langobardia Horribilis, Walfrit must find the lance and access the church, in the hope to come back alive with the sacred relic.

* 2  - Play the game -

Walfrit has a common lance, that can be used in combat. However, not every enemy will be harmed by this weapon.

* 3 - Objects

    Herbs: Found in bushes. They can be used to heal wounds. 
    Morgengabi: Found in some skeletons. They are really precious golden crosses.
    Holy lance: Found somewhere on the shallows of river Trebia. It was the objective of Walfrit's mission, and can be used in the place of the common lance after all pieces have been found.
	
Other useful objects are hidden on the river shallows, if Walfrit will explore the cursed lands to find them.

* 4 - Monsters

Monsters are Walfrit's enemies: dark creatures that will try to kill him during the search of the Holy lance.

    Strix: Monstrous vampiric bird. It can bleed an adult human to death within seconds.
    Bounded: Flying undead. Dangerous and hard to kill with common weapons.
    Wall of flesh: Prevents passage to some places. It can't be harmed by common weapons.

Other creatures populate the cursed lands of Langobardia Horribilis. Surely there is a source where these monstruosities come from...

* 5 - Echoes

Specters from the past infest some places of river Trebia. Whatever happened in that place will be brought back to life upon Walfrit's eyes, and won't always be harmless images...
